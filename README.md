## New Project Entry Form
Form allows new projects to be added to the database.  Name and location are required fields.  Others fields are optional.  Files can also be attached to each project entry and are uploaded to the server. 

If the "+" button is clicked, the user can then click on the map to populate the location fields.<br />

## TODO
- Change the land use field to a dropdown to ensure uniformity of land uses (allow multiple uses similar to file field) 
- Add query form to search the database and narrow down results
- Improve the project table to allow users to delete project entries (with a confirmation!)
